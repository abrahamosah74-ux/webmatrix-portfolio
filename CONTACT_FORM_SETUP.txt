QUICK SETUP - Contact Form Email Integration
================================================

To receive emails from your contact form, follow these steps:

STEP 1: Create Formspree Account
---------------------------------
1. Go to https://formspree.io
2. Click "Get Started" and sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address

STEP 2: Create New Form
------------------------
1. In Formspree dashboard, click "New Form"
2. Name it: "WebMatrix Contact Form"
3. Select the email where you want to receive messages
4. COPY your Form ID (it looks like: f_abc123xyz)

STEP 3: Update index.html
--------------------------
1. Open index.html in a text editor
2. Find this line (around line 154):
   <form id="contact-form" class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST">

3. Replace "your-form-id" with your actual Form ID from Step 2
4. Save the file

EXAMPLE:
--------
If your Form ID is: f_k9x2m8p5
Change the action to:
action="https://formspree.io/f_k9x2m8p5"

STEP 4: Test It
---------------
1. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Click "Send Message"
4. Check your email inbox (and spam folder)

WHAT HAPPENS:
--------------
✓ Client fills form
✓ Client clicks "Send Message"
✓ Message is sent to Formspree
✓ Formspree forwards it to your email
✓ Client sees success message

FALLBACK:
---------
If you don't have Formspree set up yet, the form will open their email client
as a fallback (mailto).

FREE TIER:
----------
- 50 submissions per month (perfect for a portfolio)
- Unlimited for $10/month if needed
