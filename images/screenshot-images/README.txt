Folder purpose: place additional Car Dealership screenshots here.

Naming guideline:

How to use:
1. Upload or copy your screenshot files into this folder.
2. Open `projects.json` and locate the Car Dealership project entry.
3. Add the new image paths to the `images` array, for example:
   "images": [
     "images/car-dealership.png",
     "images/screenshot-images/car-1.jpg",
     "images/screenshot-images/car-2.jpg"
   ],
4. Commit and push the changes. The gallery will show the added screenshots (thumbnails appear on hover).

Notes:
 - Paths no longer contain spaces (folder now `screenshot-images`), which avoids URL-encoding issues.
 - If you want, I can add example placeholder images and update `projects.json` for you.
